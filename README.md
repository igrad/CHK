# Catacombs of Halfwind Keep
Catacombs is a rogue-like game that draws heavy inspiration from Nethack and Dungeons & Dragons. Group up with a party of allies, and take to the procedurally-generated depths that lie beneath the once-great Halfwind Keep.

### Progress
Many of the core mechanics, such as level generation, collision, animations, and control handling have been implemented. I'm currently working on the first completed pass of door placement/interaction. After that, the next step is expanding player interaction and building out the player class into something that actually resembles a playable character with basic capabilities and attributes.

### Development
This is a one-man project being done passively while finishing out my Bachelor's degree. Though my ambition for this project is strong, it's not my highest concern at the moment. There is not a timeline for this or any predicted dates so far in development.
