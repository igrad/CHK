# Catacombs of Halfwind Keep
Catacombs is a rogue-like game that draws heavy inspiration from Nethack and Dungeons & Dragons. Group up with a party of allies, and take to the procedurally-generated depths that lie beneath the once-great Halfwind Keep.

### Progress
Level generation and basic character mobility functions have been completed (for now). We also have some dummy textures in the game, along with some proof of concept animations. The fundamentals of collision have also been implemented, as have 2.5D wall renderings. The next step is to begin expanding player input options and creating doors.

### Development
This is a one-man project being done passively while finishing out my Bachelor's degree. Though my ambition for this project is strong, it's not my highest concern at the moment. There will be no early access for this game, though there will be alpha and beta testing. It will likely be a very long time before we reach that stage.
